## Overview

This was a 48-hour hackathon in which a kit provided containing various electronics components and
actuators, and we also had access to laser cutters and 3D printers, the challenge was to display environmental and
power data collected from a building using a demonstration. My team built a heart using servos, which was
beating, along with RGB LED strips and fan shaking foam balls around, each element of the demonstration was representing a variable in the provided data.

## Task

I was responsible for the electronics system. A Teensy Arduino board was used to control RGB LEDs
along with servo motors and some fans controlled through MOSFETs.
Data was received from a Raspberry Pi over serial, this data contained the LED colours and the servo
speed to control the heart beating rate as shown in the video.

## Results

We won this hackathon and my team got the 1st place and I got a summer internship with Siemens because of this!
