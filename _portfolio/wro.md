# Overview

*2013 & 2014*

Participated twice in the [World Robot Olympiad](https://wro-association.org/home), Egyptian Qualifications, in the Junior Regular Category. 
This is a LEGO MINDSTORMS based competition were challenges are performed in an arena, such as identifying and collecting cubes and line following. I worked on both the 
software and hardware parts of the robot.

In both times we achieved the **2nd place** nationally.
