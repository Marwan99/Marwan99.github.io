The European Rover Challenge (ERC) is an international space robotics competition, where teams design
and build rovers to perform tasks analogous to those performed by rovers on the surface of Mars and
the Moon. I am part of the team at the university called MarsWorks.

## Tasks

I am working within the software subteam as a Robotics Software Engineer. I am responsible for the
navigation, localization and motion planning of the rover in a rough sandy mars like terrain with small hills and valleys.
My is essentially to get the rover to navigate autonomously to a target location safely, efficiently and quickly, without using GNSS or having a map of the arena.
