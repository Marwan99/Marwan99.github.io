# Overview

This was part of the [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/) competition in 2016, we were competing in the Junior Rescue category.

The challenge was to navigate through a maze while identifying victims along the way dropping an aid kit once a victim is identified. Victims were were simulated using heaters.

I worked on the hardware side of the LEGO robot, with the challenge of fitting the robot in very tight dimensions. Along with my Team, we won the **1st place** in the Egyptian finals.

My team qualified and participated in the *international competition* in Leipzig, Germany! However due to delays in the visa process I didn't manage to travel to Germany, only two team members out of four managed to travel.
