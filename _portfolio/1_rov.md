This is an annual competition which was held in the USA for building underwater remotely
operated vehicles (ROV) to perform tasks underwater. I was one of the co-founders of [Avalon](http://avalonrov.group.shef.ac.uk/),
an underwater robotics team to participate in this competition.
I can easily say that by far this is the project that taught me the most about the different systems
of a robot.

## Tasks

- Writing code for micro-controllers (arduino which is effectively C++) for
controlling/interfacing different actuators including brushed DC, stepper, BLDC
motors & pneumatic valves. Along with using communication protocols including
serial, I2C, SPI & UDP.
- Writing PID controllers
- Writing a GUI using python PyQt with the use of threads along with interfacing
joysticks to control the various aspects of the robot, the GUI showed the various robot states.
- Image Processing using OpenCV for things like shape detection, line following and length measurement.
- Power system, PCB design (THT and SMD components), working with analog,
digital & IP cameras.
- Mechanical design of electrical & pneumatic actuators, sealing against water and chassis design, this was all done on SOLIDWORKS.
- Fabrication of mechanical components using 3D printing, laser cutting, turning, CNC routing & CNC folding along with the material selection.
- Managing the mechanical, electrical and software teams, providing guidance,
technical support and facilitating decision making and lots of motivation to keep people working. I also worked on recruiting members and interviewing them.
- Raising £12,650 from various sources, contacting sponsors (managed to get free
components worth £5,500 from RS and MacArtney) and writing proposals.

## Results

All these activities took place across the 4 years I have been participating in this competition,
this year I was team’s CEO, we go the 11​ the
place out of 25 teams in the international competition which took place in Kingsport,
Tennessee and we were the 9​ th​ in the underwater product demonstration and the top team
from the UK. Also this year I was awarded one of the 3 MVP Engineering Pretension Awards
in the explorers category (university category). In the previous years I was the team’s CTO,
so I was more focused on the technical aspects of the robot.
