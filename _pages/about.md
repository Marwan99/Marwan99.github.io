Hi! I am undergrad Mechatronics and Robotics student @ [The University of Sheffiled](sheffield.ac.uk), currently on the final year of my degree.
I like tinkering with things and explore there ins and outs, this however has the minor side effect of things occasionally breaking (ops..), but trying to fix them
 forces you to really understand the thing and makes the process more fun!

I enjoy working on robots, both on the software and hardware side. I particularly enjoy the endless supply of challenges and problems associated with 
working on robots which arise from the messy world that we want them to operate in (humans are also still struggling to some degree in the same environment).

Check out the projects I have been working on [here](marwan99.github.io/projects).
